Today, I worked on several tasks related to data processing and dataset unification. Here are the key highlights:

**Accomplished:**
- Updated the `process_molecule` function to incorporate 3D features, which required reprocessing the PCQM4Mv2 dataset.

**In Progress:**
- Unifying data from the ZINC dataset:
  - Explored the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) implementation of the ZINC dataset, which introduced differences in node and edge attributes compared to the original dataset.
  - Referred to a forum post [Forum Post](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns/issues/42#issue-700553516) to resolve the mapping discrepancy in node attributes.
  - Planning to create a subclass of the PyG ZINC dataset to address the mapping differences.

- Handling the QM9 dataset:
  - Encountered differences in node and edge feature setup while working with the QM9 dataset in PyG.
  - Since the QM9 dataset is available in SDF format, incorporating the correct node and edge features should be relatively straightforward.

**Planned:**
- Exploring conformer generation:
  - Considering the possibility of generating conformers for molecules.
  - Planning to create a pipeline that seamlessly converts data from PyG to RDKit and then to Arrow format, allowing the inclusion of conformers in the dataset.

**TODOs:**
- Refine the pipeline for data conversion from PyG to RDKit and Arrow formats.
- Review the generated conformers to ensure their quality and usefulness.
- Perform additional testing and validation on the updated dataset processing methods.

Overall, today's activities involved enhancing feature representations, unifying data from different datasets, and planning for further improvements in the data pipeline. The separate list of direct TODOs highlights the specific tasks that need attention and completion in the future.
